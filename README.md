Problem Definition:

Create a digital "To-Do List" application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The application should provide functionality for users to add, edit, delete, prioritize, and mark tasks as completed. Additionally, it should allow users to organize tasks into categories or projects, set deadlines, receive reminders, and potentially collaborate with others on shared tasks.

Key Features:

1. Task Management:
   - Add new tasks with a title, description, deadline, priority level, and category/project.
   - Edit existing tasks to update information such as title, description, deadline, priority, or category.
   - Delete tasks that are no longer needed.
   - Mark tasks as completed to track progress.

2. Organization:
   - Categorize tasks into different projects or categories for better organization.
   - Allow users to create, edit, and delete categories or projects.
   - Provide filtering and sorting options to view tasks based on categories, deadlines, priorities, etc.

3. Reminders and Notifications:
   - Set reminders for upcoming deadlines or important tasks.
   - Send notifications to users for upcoming tasks or overdue deadlines.

4. User Interface:
   - Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy task management.
   - Implement features such as drag-and-drop for rearranging tasks, color-coding for priorities, etc.

5. Collaboration (Optional):
   - Allow users to share tasks or projects with others for collaborative work.
   - Implement features like task assignment, commenting, and real-time updates for shared tasks.

6. Synchronization:
   - Enable synchronization across multiple devices/platforms to access tasks from anywhere.

7. Security:
   - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data privacy and security.
   - Encrypt sensitive information such as task details, deadlines, etc., to protect user data.

8. Performance and Scalability:
   - Ensure the application performs efficiently, even with a large number of tasks and users.
   - Design the system to scale easily as the user base grows.

9. Accessibility:
   - Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities by following accessibility standards and guidelines.

10. Backup and Restore:
    - Provide mechanisms to backup user data regularly and allow for easy restoration in case of data loss or corruption.

Overall, the goal is to create a robust and user-friendly To-Do List application that helps individuals and teams manage their tasks effectively, stay organized, and increase productivity.
